    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 14, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>NaturalThai ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>NaturalThai operates primarily offline and stores all data locally on your device. We collect and store:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Video Watch History:</strong> Records of videos you've watched and your comprehension ratings</li>
        <li><strong>Vocabulary Data:</strong> Words you've saved and your flashcard review history</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Progress:</strong> Your performance metrics and spaced repetition scheduling data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of this data is stored locally on your device using SQLite database. We do not transmit or store this data on external servers.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Content</h2>
    <p>Our app displays video content from YouTube through embedded players. When you watch videos:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>YouTube may collect data according to their own privacy policy</li>
        <li>Your device will need internet access to stream video content</li>
        <li>We do not track or store information about your YouTube viewing behavior beyond what you explicitly save in the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>All your learning data is stored locally on your device in an encrypted SQLite database. We do not have access to this data, and it is not transmitted to any servers operated by us.</p>

    <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app requires the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Internet Access:</strong> To stream YouTube videos</li>
        <li><strong>Network State:</strong> To check connectivity before attempting to load videos</li>
        <li><strong>Wake Lock:</strong> To keep the screen on while watching videos</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete all your data at any time by uninstalling the app. Since all data is stored locally, uninstalling the app will permanently remove all your learning history and vocabulary.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. All data remains on the user's device.</p>

        <li>Delete individual vocabulary items or watch history entries</li>
